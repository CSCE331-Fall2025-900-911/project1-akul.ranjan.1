        <h2>USAA - SWE Internship</h2>At a financial services company, I worked on Java and Spring Boot services that process tens of thousands of monthly transactions. I focused on data consistency and performance, helping reduce service latency and ensuring the APIs behaved reliably under load. I also automated deployment steps in a Git-based CI/CD pipeline, cutting release time dramatically and enabling regular, uneventful production rollouts.</p>

        <h2>Texas A&M Viz Labs - AI Developer</h2>
        <p>As an AI developer in an academic lab setting, I helped build a conversational simulation tool used in training scenarios. I concentrated on pragmatic improvements: refining prompt strategies to lower token usage while keeping answer quality high, adding feedback loops with non-technical stakeholders, and capturing the right telemetry so we could see where the system was strong or brittle. The result was a tool people used more often and rated more highly.</p>

        <h2>Texas A&M Agricultural Department - AI/ML Researcher</h2>
        <p>In applied research, I contributed to a chatbot that synthesizes insights from a large corpus of technical papers. My role spanned the stack: React on the front end, a FastAPI service layer, vector search for retrieval, and a data layer tuned for responsiveness. I measured the system end to end and made targeted changes—like reorganizing the storage layer—to bring average response time down substantially.</p>

      <p>Beyond internships and research, I’ve shipped competition and side projects. A puzzle-solving AI service won a campus datathon by combining semantic similarity with lightweight heuristics; another project scored large datasets for investment screening with sub-second turnaround. These efforts sharpened two habits I bring to every codebase: document assumptions early and design small experiments that tell you whether a change actually helped.</p>
