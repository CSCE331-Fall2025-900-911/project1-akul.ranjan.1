      <h2>My Journey in Computer Science and Future Goals</h2>
      <p>I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science at Texas A&amp;M University who enjoys shipping practical software that makes everyday workflows smoother. My recent work centers on voice-driven assistants and the ergonomics of human–computer interaction. I've been developing a small agent that can listen, understand intent, and respond via high-quality text-to-speech while integrating with calendars and other everyday tools. The technical challenge I like most is turning brittle prototypes into stable, predictable experiences that real people trust. That requires clear interfaces, guardrails around external APIs, and observability that explains why something happened—not just that it did.</p>
      
      <p>On the systems side, I value clean code and repeatable processes. I've built algorithm exercises and small services with automated tests, and I'm comfortable navigating Linux, version control, and the basics of secure configuration. I enjoy the craft of readable C++ and the practicality of modern JavaScript. I also like product thinking: defining the smallest slice that delivers user value, then iterating. A good day is one where I can both fix something low-level and improve the user experience at the same time.</p>
      
      <p>My technical interests span several key areas in computer science. I'm particularly drawn to artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially as they apply to natural language processing and conversational interfaces. The intersection of AI and human-computer interaction fascinates me because it represents the future of how we'll interact with technology. I'm also passionate about systems programming and performance optimization, having spent considerable time working with C++ and understanding how software interacts with hardware at a fundamental level.</p>
      
      <p>Over the next year, I want to deepen three areas: (1) robust speech and intent pipelines that operate with low latency on everyday hardware; (2) privacy-respecting agents that keep sensitive data local when possible and request explicit consent for anything shared; and (3) approachable UI patterns for conversational software, including accessible voice and keyboard controls. I'm particularly interested in teams where engineering and design collaborate closely and everyone ships. I'm excited by roles where I can contribute to production systems, learn from code reviews, and help build tools that feel almost invisible—because they work so reliably.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond technical skills, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and community contribution. Outside the editor, I like mentoring peers and documenting "gotchas" so others can avoid the same bumps I hit. I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies, whether that's diving into the latest web frameworks, experimenting with new programming languages, or understanding emerging trends in software architecture. If you're curious about any of the projects here, I'd love to chat. Resources I like: Eloquent JavaScript, MDN, and W3Schools.</p>
