      <h2>What I’m aiming to build next</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an undergraduate in Computer Science at Texas A&amp;M University who enjoys shipping practical software
        that makes everyday workflows smoother. My recent work centers on voice-driven assistants and the ergonomics of
        human–computer interaction. I’ve been developing a small agent that can listen, understand intent, and respond
        via high-quality text-to-speech while integrating with calendars and other everyday tools. The technical
        challenge I like most is turning brittle prototypes into stable, predictable experiences that real people trust.
        That requires clear interfaces, guardrails around external APIs, and observability that explains why something
        happened—not just that it did.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the systems side, I value clean code and repeatable processes. I’ve built algorithm exercises and small
        services with automated tests, and I’m comfortable navigating Linux, version control, and the basics of secure
        configuration. I enjoy the craft of readable C++ and the practicality of modern JavaScript. I also like product
        thinking: defining the smallest slice that delivers user value, then iterating. A good day is one where I can
        both fix something low-level and improve the user experience at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next year, I want to deepen twp areas: (1) robust speech and intent pipelines that operate with low
        latency on everyday hardware; (2) approachable UI patterns for conversational software,
        including accessible voice and keyboard controls. I’m particularly interested in teams where engineering and
        design collaborate closely and everyone ships. I’m excited by roles where I can contribute to production
        systems, learn from code reviews, and help build tools that feel almost invisible—because they work so reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the editor, I like mentoring peers.
        If you’re curious about any of the projects here, I’d love to chat. Resources I like:
