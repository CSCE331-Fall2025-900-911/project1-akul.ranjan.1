      <h2>What I’m aiming to build next</h2>
      <p>
        Technically, I am comfortable across the full stack. On the back end, I work with Java and Python to build APIs and small services; on the front end, I am productive with modern JavaScript frameworks and the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I’m confident with Git-based workflows, code reviews, and the basics of secure configuration. I’ve used containerization to make environments reproducible and I understand how CI/CD pipelines reduce risk when teams ship frequently. In data work, I enjoy wrangling inputs into clean, testable functions and adding instrumentation that answers “what happened” and “why.”
      </p>
      <p>
        On the systems side, I value clean code and repeatable processes. I’ve built algorithm exercises and small
        services with automated tests, and I’m comfortable navigating Linux, version control, and the basics of secure
        configuration. I enjoy the craft of readable C++ and the practicality of modern JavaScript. I also like product
        thinking: defining the smallest slice that delivers user value, then iterating. A good day is one where I can
        both fix something low-level and improve the user experience at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next year, I want to deepen three areas: (1) robust speech and intent pipelines that operate with low
        latency on everyday hardware; (2) privacy-respecting agents that keep sensitive data local when possible and
        request explicit consent for anything shared; and (3) approachable UI patterns for conversational software,
        including accessible voice and keyboard controls. I’m particularly interested in teams where engineering and
        design collaborate closely and everyone ships. I’m excited by roles where I can contribute to production
        systems, learn from code reviews, and help build tools that feel almost invisible—because they work so reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skills behind these interests are ones I practice regularly: writing readable code, testing behavior at seams, documenting decisions, and profiling to see where time goes. I’m also certified at a foundational level in cloud concepts and have hands-on experience with modern tooling for orchestration, monitoring, and deployment. What matters most to me, though, is not a checklist—it’s the habit of measuring outcomes, learning quickly, and choosing the simplest design that works. Some reasources I like to learn from are:
